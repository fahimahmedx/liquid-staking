SpringSui is a Liquid Staking Token (LST). It offers significant improvements over existing LSTs, most notably instant unstaking. Instant unstaking allows for infinite liquidity when unstaking, enhancing safety by reducing the risk of depegging. In the future, other teams will be able to deploy their own LSTs on the platform permissionlessly and at no cost using the SpringSui Standard. 

Anyone can launch an LST for free with the SpringSui standard. Contact us on twitter to get started!
